# About me

Hi! My name is Yorgos Bos, I am a biology student at Utrecht University. My interests are toxicology, cell biology and microbiology. In my free time, I work at a student deployment agency and an take active part in my students' union. I mainly work at FC Utrecht via my deployment agency, where I am responsible for managing a vending point and sometimes multiple. At my students' union, I was at the head of the cooking committee and will be the head of the cultural committee next year. 

Since I was a child I have had an interest in computers and programming, so the hours that remain I mostly spend on studying computer science. In the past years I have learnt to program in R and Python. (I took a class for both, which my studies allowed in the curriculum) I also started tinkering with DIY boards like the Wemos D1 mini and Raspberry Pi. I use these to remotely control the lights in my room üòÅ.

Lastly, I started some web development, of which this website is a part. This site is hosted on GitHub pages and developing it has given me a lot of insights of how git and GitHub work, introduced me to frameworks like Jekyll and Bootstrap and given me a basic understanding of Sass.
