# About me

Hi! My name is Yorgos Bos, I am a biology student at Utrecht University. I'm particularly interested in toxicology, cell biology and to a lesser extend microbiology. In my spare time, I work for a student deployment agency and an take active part in my students' union. At my students' union, I was at the head of the cooking committee and the cultural committee. 

## My interests
Since I was a child I have had an interest in computers and programming. So in my free time I try to explore this. To this purpose I have learnt to program in the past few years. A key part in this was having to learn R for my studies. This has led me to pursue coding further, taking a Programming with Python [course][1] I also started tinkering with DIY boards like the Wemos D1 mini and Raspberry Pi. This has yielded me a greater understanding of how appliances work. Working with the Rasperry Pi has also given me insight in working with Linux computers.

## Recent projects
I've started some web development, for instance building this site. Whilst doing this I've learned a lot. For instance using git and jekyll. Also, I've started using Sass with this project.
